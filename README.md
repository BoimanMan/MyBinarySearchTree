# MyBinarySearchTree
Binary Search Tree project from the CMPS 261 course at University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2018.

Implements a Binary Search Tree data structure that features inserting, deleting, and displaying nodes in preorder, inorder, and postorder sequences. The preorder method also has
a version using an Iterator object. Includes a file that creates an example of the data structure and uses the methods in MyBinarySearchTree.java to demonstrate that the methods
are operational. Created in 2018 for the CMPS 261 course at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.
